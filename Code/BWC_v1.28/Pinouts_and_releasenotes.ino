/* * 
 * v1.28 
 * MQTT version
 * Will pull to MASTER branch after feedback from you
 * Enter credentials in TAB "User_parameters.h"
 * Also comment or uncomment the defines you want there.
 * Removed "use mqtt" checkbox from main web page since you decide whether or not to use it from "user_parameters"
 * 
 *  
 * v1.27 (p2) MQTT branch
 * 877dev, thanks for your inputs and code
 * Pubsub library must be 2.8.0 or higher to allow larger messages.
 * 
 * patch 2
 * smashed a bug - autofilter on didn't work in some occasions. It does now.
 * 
 * v1.27
 * Reworked code
 * Switched to LittleFS since SPIFFS is deprecated
 * SPA control page shows stats and ESP can be rebooted
 * New SPA config page
 * Selectable auto events
 * Audio on/off
 * 
 * Config: filter on/off turns the filter on and off. It remembers last state when turning on.
 * Allowed heater hours: Intended to protect main fuses to pop when you come home from work and turn on every gadget you own...
 * When auto mode is on the heater is turned off on theese hours, and you will not be able to turn it on manually.
 * 
 * In absense of mr Frankenstein, I took the artistic freedom to add my logo/avatar ;-). I bet you will replace it.
 * 
 * v1.26
 * Bug fixes:
 * Turning off heater from webpage did not work
 * Target temp did not update when using real buttons on the pump
 * 
 * v1.25
 * filter out glitches from CIO (cleaner logs)
 * 
 * v1.24
 * hardcoded filteroff/on hours (to be adjustable via wifi later on)
 * 
 * v1.23
 * Chlorine timer button added
 * Update heatingtime before logsave
 * Calculates ratio heatingtime/uptime
 * 

  As seen when looking into the connectors
